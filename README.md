Drupal-Riddle
============

This module was developed for the annual technical festival for my graduate school. I designed an online web treasure hunt challenge around programming skills and general web awareness. This code-project was the basic engine to manage it. It was hosted on code.google.com, later @nmudgal hosted this project on drupal.org

So basically by using 'Riddle' is a pluggable drupal module which is able to create challenge based a sequence of question. For each question you can configure maximum number of attempts. It takes care of the question accessibility and rankings. Though now using drupal's entity framework and some trivial hook implementation more elegant solution can be created but this project provides a simple ready to go platform.
